# SRSA
SRSA stands for Steam Recommender Systems Analysis.

This project was done by Richard C Thompson and Al Nolasco for their CS 484 - Data Mining course in their final semester at George Mason University. 

The authors took a dataset from the game application Steam and created multiple different recommender systems on the data to determine what system and what data would be best used to recommend video games to Steam's consumers. The report and source files are in this project.
